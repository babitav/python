# How to run the code
1. Please ensure python is installed on your machine.
2. Run each individual program on the command prompt by typing 'python filename.py' where filename.py is the oythin file name to be run.

# What each file contains
1. sumupto.py - This is the solution to the first program of the problem set. This program accepts a positive integer and calculates and displays the sum of numbers starting from 1 till the given input number.

2. begins-with-t.py - This is the solution to the 2nd program of the problem set. This program checks and displays whether the current day begins with 'T' or not.

3. divisors.py - This is the solution to the 3rd program of the problem set. This program displays all numbers between 1000 and 10000 which are divisible by 6 but not by 12.

4. collatz.py - This is the solution to the 4th program of the problem set. This program
inputs a +ve number and performs calculations - if the number is even, multiplies the value by 2. If the number is odd, multiplies the value by 3 and adds 1. The program ends when the  value becomes 1. All the calculated numbers are displayed.

5. primes.py - This is the solution to the 5th program of the problem set. This program inputs a positive number, and checks if the number is prime or not. It displays the message accordingly.

6. secondstring.py - This is the solution to the 6th program of the problem set. This program
accepts a user input string and displays every second word of the input string.

7. squareroot.py - This is the solution to the 7th program of the problem set. This program inputs a +ve float number, and determines the approx. square root of the given number.

8. date_time.py - This is the solution to the 8th program of the problem set. This program
displays todays date and time in the given format.

9. second.py - This is the solution to the 9th program of the problem set. This program accepts the filename from argument on command line and reads the given file, and ouputs / displays every second / alternate line.

10. plotfunction.py - This is the solution to the 10th program of the problem set. This program displays the function f(x) = x, x*x, and2**x on the graph.
